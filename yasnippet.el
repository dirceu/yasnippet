;;; Commentary:

;; Basic steps to setup:
;;   1. Place `yasnippet.el' in your `load-path'.
;;   2. In your .emacs file:
;;        (require 'yasnippet)
;;   3. Place the `snippets' directory somewhere.  E.g: ~/.emacs.d/snippets
;;   4. In your .emacs file
;;        (yas/initialize)
;;        (yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/snippets")
